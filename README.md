# NewGame
This is a new game that I am creating. I don't exactly know what it is about myself, I am just currently developing 
some basic logic. Thats why the name is just NewGame.

To play the game, click on the desktop-1.0.jar file and download it.
You can run it either by double clicking it or through the terminal.
