# NewGame
This is a new game that I am creating. I don't exactly know what it is about myself, I am just currently developing 
some basic logic. Thats why the name is just NewGame.

To play the game, click on the desktop-1.0.jar file and download it.
You can run it either by double clicking it or through the terminal.

Instruction on how to play:
<br>
WASD to move.
<br>
R to toggle camera follow.
<br>
LeftShift to move camera to player.
<br>
Right Click and Drag to move camera around the field.
